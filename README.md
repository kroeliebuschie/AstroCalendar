# AstroCalendar

Convert the calendar with astronomical events (from seasky.org) to iCal

### How to use?

You can just run the script like this:

```bash
pipenv run python3 getAstroCal.py
```

This will create an iCal file.

### How to edit?
The script is set to make an iCal containing the events from 2018-2034. You can change this by editing line 33, add one to the last year.
`years = [1969, 1985]` for example will set the range from 1969 to 1984.
