UID:2020-01-032020-01-04Quadrantids Meteor Shower@seasky.org
DESCRIPTION:The Quadrantids is an above average shower with up to 40 meteo
 rs per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left 
 behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1\, which was discovered in 200
 3. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the ni
 ght of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th. The first quarter moon will set sh
 ortly after midnight\, leaving fairly dark skies for what could be a good 
 show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors wi
 ll radiate from the constellation Bootes\, but can appear anywhere in the 
 sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION:The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe\, pr
 oducing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swi
 ft-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for prod
 ucing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July
  17 to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of the 11th and morning 
 of the 12th. The second quarter moon will block out some of the fainter me
 teors this year\, but the Perseids are so bright and numerous that it shou
 ld still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after m
 idnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus\, but can app

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. This year\, the
  nearly new moon will leave dark skies for what should be an excellent sho

DESCRIPTION:The Leonids is an average shower\, producing an average of up 
 to 15 meteors per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a
  cyclonic peak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can
  be seen. That last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by 
 dust grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1
 865. The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on th
 e night of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The second quarter moon will 
 block many of the fainter meteors this year. But the Leonids can be unpred
 ictable so there is still potential for a good show. Best viewing will be 
 from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constel
 lation Leo\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.se

 003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the 
 night of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th. The waning gibbous moon will blo

DESCRIPTION:The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing on
 ly about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two s
 eparate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Aster
 oid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Come
 t 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It p
 eaks this year on the the night of November 4. Unfortunately the glare for
 m the full moon will hide most of the meteors this year. If you are really
  patient\, you may still be able to catch a few bright ones. Best viewing 
 will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights
 . Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus\, but can appear anyw
 here in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION:The Leonids is an average shower\, producing up to 15 meteors 
 per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak
  about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That
  last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains le

 r runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the
  17th and morning of the 18th. This should be an excellent year for the Le
 onids. The thin\, crescent moon won't be much of a problem and skies will 
 be dark enough for what should be an great show. Best viewing will be from

DESCRIPTION:The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteo
 rs per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tuttle\, w
 hich was first discovered in 1790. The shower runs annually from December 
 17-25. It peaks this year on the the night of the 21st and morning of the 
 22nd. Unfortunately the near full moon will block all but the brightest me
 teors this year. If you are extremely patient\, you may be able to catch a
  few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a
  dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the co

DESCRIPTION:An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is too far away 
 from the Earth to completely cover the Sun. This results in a ring of ligh
 t around the darkened Moon. The Sun's corona is not visible during an annu
 lar eclipse.  The path of the eclipse will begin in the Pacific Ocean off 
 the coast of South America and move across Ecuador\, Peru\, and Brazil. It
  will then move out into the Atlantic Ocean where it will end in Spain and
  Portugal. A partial eclipse will be visible throughout most of North Amer
 ica\, Central America\, South America\, western Europe\, and northwestern 
 Africa. (NASA  Map and Eclipse Information)\n        (NASA Interactive Goo

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The waning gibb
 ous moon will block out most of the fainter meteors this year. But if you 
 are extremely patient\, you may still be able to catch a few good ones. Be
 st viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from
  city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco\, but can 
 appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION:The asteroid Apophis will make its closest approach to Earth. 
 Discovered in 2004\, Apophis is approximately 1\,066 feet (325 meters) in 
 diameter. The giant space rock will pass as close as 19\,400 miles (31\,30
 0 kilometers) to the Earth's surface. This will bring it within the orbits
  of geosynchronous communication satellites. It may reach a magnitude of 3
 .4\, making it visible to the naked eye from a dark night sky location. Si
 nce there will be no moon\, this could be a spectacular event. Though it w
 ill be an extremely close encounter\, there is only a on in a million chan
 ce of the asteroid actually hitting the Earth. (copyright: http://www.seas

DESCRIPTION:The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing on
 ly about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two s
 eparate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Aster
 oid 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Come
 t 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It p
 eaks this year on the the night of November 4. The nearly new moon means d
 ark skies for what could be a really good show this year. Best viewing wil
 l be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. M
 eteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus\, but can appear anywher
 e in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 r runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the
  17th and morning of the 18th. The nearly full moon will block most of the
  fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you may still be able

DESCRIPTION:The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\, producing up to 120 mul
 ticolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behi
 nd by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\, which was discovered in 1982. T
 he shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the nigh
 t of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The glare from the waning gibbous m
 oon will obscure many of the fainter meteors this year. But the Geminids a
 re so bright and numerous that this could still be a good show. Best viewi
 ng will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from 
 the constellation Gemini\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright:

DESCRIPTION:The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteo
 rs per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tuttle\, w
 hich was first discovered in 1790. The shower runs annually from December 
 17-25. It peaks this year on the the night of the 21st and morning of the 
 22nd. The thin\, crescent moon should not be too much of a problem this ye
 ar. The skies will be dark enough for what could be a really good show. Be
 st viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from 
 city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor\, but 
 can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)
